# JAVASCRIPT
- The console.log() command is used to print, or log, text to the console. Consider the following example: console.log("Hello!");
- Strings: Any grouping of keyboard characters (letters, spaces, numbers, or symbols) surrounded by single quotes ('Hello') or double quotes ("World!"). In the example above, 'New York City' is a string.
- Numbers: Any number, including numbers with decimals: 4, 1516, .002, 23.42. In the example above, 40.7 is a number.
- Booleans: Either true or false, with no quotations. In the example above, true is a boolean.
- Null: Can only be null. It represents the absence of value.
- JavaScript supports the following math operators:
Add: +
Subtract: -
Multiply: *
Divide: /
These all work how you might guess:

console.log(3 + 4); // Equals 7
console.log(5 - 1); // Equals 4
console.log(4 * 2); // Equals 8
console.log(9 / 3); // Equals 3

- For example, every string instance has a property called length that stores the number of characters in it. You can retrieve property information by appending the string with a period and the property name:

- console.log('Hello'.length);
In the example above, the value saved to the length property is retrieved from the string, 'Hello'. The program prints 5 to the console, because Hello has five characters in it.
On the first line, the .toUpperCase() method is called on the string instance 'Hello'. The result is logged to the console. This method returns a string in all capital letters: 'HELLO'.
On the second line, the .startsWith() method is called on the string instance "Hey". This method also accepts the character 'H' as an input between the opening and closing parentheses. Since the string 'Hey' does start with the letter 'H', the method returns the boolean true.
- If you wish to get rid of whitespace, use the .trim method.
- If you want to use method without an instance, javascript libraries will be needed. 
- Four essential data types in JavaScript include strings, numbers, booleans, and null.
- Data is printed, or logged, to the console with console.log().
- Four built-in mathematical operators include +, -, *, and /.
- JavaScript associates certain properties with different data types.
- JavaScript has built-in methods for different data types.
- Libraries are collections of methods that can be called without an instance.
- You can write single-line comments with // and multi-line comments between /* and */.
